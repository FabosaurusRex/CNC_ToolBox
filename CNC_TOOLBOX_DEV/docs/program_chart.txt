        at any given time

    - will have control over loading in workbenches

workbenches (wb)
    - each workbench should work independently
    - workbenches should have their own unit tests associated with them

Pro of a workbench based program
    - all in one page, no need to skip around

Cons
    - all in one page, may get clustered

How to split the difference
    - have workbenches that load depending on combo box selection
    - have plugins that load based off of an options menu
